# DONE: stop saving on the "quit_without_saving" and "reload" commands, trust the user instead of
        forcing them to manually delete the backup file later

# consider placement:



# do next:

# TODO: probably need to put the modify command back as it was removed with this last commit
    Should consider what other complication may be induced in terms of what "modify" should end
            up looking like
        May anyways be better to add modify back in later after first developing things without it
        Could put in many modify commands
            Add command to just change the date and or time or duration of an event

# TODO: should there really be no duration for attendance events?
    Instead of duration there could just be an "end time"
        At any rate there is no need to show this the same as a deadline event if the duration
                is just always going to be zero

# TODO: fix big parse function in Input_Parser to make the part that calls the parse functions
        and then maybe gets a str simpler, just chunky repetitive ifs for no reason

# TODO: allow filtered schedule print based on 'type' and 'tag'
# TODO: add some sort of totals of durations, and totals by event type

# TODO: allow events to lack a date, so they are just todos basically

# TODO: add command b int which print a given number of blanks, with a default number

# TODO: fix formatting so that each event lines up regardless of id digits

# TODO: add some manner of feature regarding removing events that have passed

# TODO: add recurring events

# TODO: consider autosave and more intelligent backup saver
# TODO: add delete backups function



# unsorted:
# TODO: integrate my human readable csv in terms of settings input
# TODO: put some variable somewhere for the '.' and '|' and ' ' chars
# TODO: figure out the os Traceback occurring from 'python Scheduler.py' run in the project
        directory in the command line
# TODO: put back in info logging of commands without console output
# TODO:? consolidate input parser direct function tests
# TODO: add more tests
