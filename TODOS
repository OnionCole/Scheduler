# DONE: Allow changing end_time and duration to None values through the modify commands
    to change the arg to None you should have to type none, anyways you have no
            choice but to just demand a string and check for "none" here and
            deal with that from there
    need to note in the help that you can type "none" here



# doing now:

# do next:

# TODO: Improve formatting of printed lines
    Stop padding times with a zero and just pad with a space, harder to see with the zero
    Fix the formatting on the id so that each event lines up regardless of id digits even to the
            right of the id
        Just use the "highest id" value to figure how much to space by

# TODO: allow events to lack a date, so they are just todos basically
    ! Maybe should not do this, after all the purpose of a scheduler is to deal with dates and
            times, todos and priorities are for a todo_ manager
        Anyways for this to serve as a todo_ manager I would have to put all my todos in it but
                that does not make sense, it is better just to use it to keep appointments and
                deadlines
        ! But could just put *some* todos
        ! Could use scheduler for recurring todos

# TODO: make some kind of "full print" command that has a fuller print, for instance could include
        totals of durations and maybe appointment time and other information and formatting that we
        will keep thinking of

# TODO: ? make the logging actually work, when a critical error is observed, nothing gets logged

# TODO: fix big parse function in Input_Parser to make the part that calls the parse functions
        and then maybe gets a str simpler, just chunky repetitive ifs for no reason

# TODO: allow filtered schedule print based on 'type' and 'tag'
# TODO: add some sort of totals of durations, and totals by event type

# TODO: Could put in many modify commands
        Add command to just change the date and or time or duration of an event

# TODO: add some manner of feature regarding removing events that have passed

# TODO: add recurring events

# TODO: consider autosave and more intelligent backup saver
# TODO: add delete backups function

# TODO: For attendance events could allow inputting a duration instead of an end time and having
        the program calculate the end time from that



# unsorted:
# TODO: integrate my human readable csv in terms of settings input
# TODO: put some variable somewhere for the '.' and '|' and ' ' chars
# TODO: figure out the os Traceback occurring from 'python Scheduler.py' run in the project
        directory in the command line
# TODO: put back in info logging of commands without console output
# TODO:? consolidate input parser direct function tests
# TODO: add more tests
